# RE-NFA-DFA
This project, designed for a Theory of Computation (TOC) course, involves converting a Regular Expression (RE) to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), and then converting the NFA to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The project will visualize both the NFA and DFA and generate a PDF containing these visualizations.

NOTE: Have a file output.json in the folder.

How to Run
Run the Re_to_NFA_Main.py script.
Enter the Regular Expression (RE) when prompted.
Run the NFA_to_DFA_Main.py script.
You will receive the output.
