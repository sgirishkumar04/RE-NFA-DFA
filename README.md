# RE-NFA-DFA
This project, designed for a Theory of Computation (TOC) course, involves converting a Regular Expression (RE) to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), and then converting the NFA to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The project will visualize both the NFA and DFA and generate a PDF containing these visualizations.
